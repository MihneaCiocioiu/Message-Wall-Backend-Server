# Message-Wall-Backend-Server

This repository contains the backend of my MEAN project.

The frontend can be found here: https://github.com/MihneaCiocioiu/Message-Wall

To run the project, run node app.js in your termina.

The backend is handling HTTP requests using express.js and is using the Mongodb database for storing user posts.
